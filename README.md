# Math
python/java scripts implementing numerical techniques or demo's for math concepts

## Monte carlo integration
After watching think twice's video on this, I immediately wanted to implement it. I looked around to
see which PRNG I could write myself. I came across [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/) and it became a
strong impulse to code it. I coded the LCG RNG, and learned about "generators" in python. I compared it with numpy's random function.
